# Netflix-Data-Analysis


Project Title: Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization

Project Description:

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of publicly available Netflix data from the internet, focusing on uncovering key insights related to user behaviors, trends, and content preferences. The steps involved included:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: I performed extensive data cleaning, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure that the dataset was ready for analysis. This involved transforming data into the appropriate formats and standardizing column names for easier analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted an in-depth analysis to understand patterns and distributions across various metrics, including movie ratings, genres, user demographics, and viewing habits.

Visualizing Key Insights: Using Python's Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, I visualized the answers to the five most frequently asked questions related to Netflix data. These included insights on:

1.What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?

2.Which has highest votes in vote avg column?

3.What movie got the highest popularity? what is its genre?

4.What movie got the lowest popularity? what is its genre?

5.Which year has the most filmed movies?

Outcome: The visualizations provided a clear and accessible way to interpret complex data, offering valuable insights for content creators, marketers, and data analysts looking to understand viewer preferences and optimize offerings on the platform.

This project not only enhanced my data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills but also gave me a deep understanding of the impact of data-driven decisions in the entertainment industry.
